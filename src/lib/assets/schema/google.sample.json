The model is trained on the UCI Census Income Dataset. This is not a production model, and this dataset has traditionally only been used for research purposes. In this Model Card, you can review quantative components of the nmodel's performance and data, as well as information about the model's intended uses, limitations, and ethical considerations.",

Furthermore the ratio of $50,000 or less earner to $50,000 or more earners is just over 3:1. Due to the imbalance across income levels, we can see that our true negative rate seems quite high, while our true positive rate seems quite low. This is true to an even greater degree when we only look at the \"female\" sub-group, because there are even fewer female examples in the $50,000+ earner group, causing our model to overfit these examples. To avoid this, we can try various remidiation strategies in future iterations (e.g. undersampling, hyperparameter tuning, etc.), but we may not be able to fix all of the fairness issues."
